# CUSTOMER-SEGMENTATION-PROJECT
Customer Segmentation Project Overview
This project aims to divide our customer base into distinct groups based on their characteristics, behaviors, and preferences. By applying clustering analysis and machine learning techniques to our customer data, we seek to:
- Identify and understand the unique needs and preferences of each segment
- Develop targeted marketing strategies and personalized experiences to enhance customer engagement and loyalty
- Improve product development and recommendation systems to meet the specific needs of each segment
- Optimize resource allocation and business decision-making with data-driven insights
Through this project, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of our customers and drive business growth by delivering more effective and tailored experiences.
